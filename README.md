#About The Muslim Youth Group

Salaams and greetings friends,<br /><br />Welcome to the Muslim Youth Group of South Bay, California! We are a new and safe space for young individuals to gain knowledge and have fun. We do this through our events that we host once a month. We centralize our efforts around Islam, striving to please Our Creator and implementing the teachings of our beloved prophet (PBUH). Yet at the same time we hope to create an environment that is enjoyable and appealing to the youth today. 

Thank you so much for checking our page out! Hope to see you at our next event!<br /><br /></p>
